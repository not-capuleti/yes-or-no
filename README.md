# Yes or no project
## Run the project in the browser
    npm i
    npm start
Navigate to http://localhost:3001

## Description
It is a simple project in React which uses [Yes or no API](https://yesno.wtf/ "Yes or no API") to answer the questions asked in the input field.

After writing your question in the input field, just click the button below it and do not be afraid to get the answer (although I know it can be scary). If you leave the input field blank, an alert will be displayed (just to remind you that any question should be asked to receive any answer).

The answer provided to you is a "yes" or "no" word with a funny (I assume) gif next to it.

### Have fun!
But maybe you better not use the project as a tool to respond to the boyfriend's proposal or other life-important decisions.
